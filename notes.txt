Users should receive a text message to a provided number whenever one of the following happens:
A user requests to book their space
Their request to book a space is confirmed
Their request to book a space is denied

The above code is present in the send_sms file

We will then need to:
- modify the user.create method to also take a mobile number
  attr_reader :user_id, :email, :mobile_number
  def initialize(user_id:, email:, mobile_number:)
    @user_id = user_id
    @email = email
    @mobile_number = mobile_number
  end
  def self.create(email:, password:, mobile_number:) #both hosts and guests do this
    encrypted_password = BCrypt::Password.create(password)
    result = DatabaseConnection.query("INSERT INTO users (email, password, mobile_number) VALUES('#{email}', '#{encrypted_password}', '#{mobile_number}) RETURNING user_id, email, mobile_number;")
    User.new(user_id: result[0]['user_id'], email: result[0]['email'], mobile_number: result[0]['mobile_number'])
  end

- each of the times we want to send an sms, we'll have to find the user, 
u = User.find(id: session['id'])
- then, generate the appropriate sms, eg one of the below
SMS.new(to: u.mobile_number).booking_request
SMS.new(to: u.mobile_number).request_confirmed
SMS.new(to: u.mobile_number).request_denied
